    h3 Michael Rausch
    p Hi, Iâ€™m Michael, a final-year Computer Science student studying at the University of Canterbury. I am seeking an internship that will allow me to grow and develop both my technical and professional skills in a real-world environment. I particularly enjoy building mobile and web applications, however, I'm also looking to explore other areas such as DevOps and security.
